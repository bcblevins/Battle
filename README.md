# Battle #  

<p>This program is a game where you battle a bandit. The player is asked to select a character class which will determine their moves, starting health, and inventory. Each round the bandit chooses a random attack and the player responds with their own attack.
</p>

<p>In addition to the character class's basic moves, they also have item(s) in their inventory they can use which will not take up the whole turn.
</p>

<p>The character class information is stored in Java classes which, after a class is selected, is stored into local variables to be used for the game.
</p>

<p>The game is considered finished when either the player's or the bandit's health drops below zero.</p>
